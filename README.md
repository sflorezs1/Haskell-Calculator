# Calculator
## Made by:
Simon Florez (sflorezs1) and Julian Bueno (jdbuenol)
## How to use
- Install all dependences: Data.List.Split (stack install split)
- Load src/Main.hs in ghci
- Write an expression
## Valid Expressions
### The calculator can do:
- addition (m + n)
- substraction (m - n)
- multiplication (m * n)
- division (m / n)
- potentiation (m ^ n)
- sin (Sin(a), where a is an angle)
- cos (Cos(a), where a is an angle)
- tan (Tan(a), where a is an angle)
- sinh (Sinh(a), where a is an angle)
- cosh (Cosh(a), where a is an angle)
- ln (Ln(n))
- decisions (a ? b : c, where a is a boolean expression [n < m, for instance] and b, c are normal expressions)
- cicles ([initial; final; step; expression])
### Example of a valid expression: [(8>7?5:4);<Sin(90)*8;(188+167)^0;[1;<5;1;4+8]] and that would be equal to: 144
